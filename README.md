**Car Showroom Management System - Python Project**

This repository contains a Python-based Car Showroom Management System that utilizes nested `if` statements to streamline the decision-making process within the system. The project simulates an interactive interface for managing a car showroom, where users can view available car models, check pricing, and apply various filters based on car attributes like brand, color, and type.

Key Features:
- **Nested If Statements**: The core logic of the showroom system employs nested `if` statements to evaluate multiple conditions and provide tailored results to the user. For example, it checks user input for brand preference, car type, and budget to display relevant car models.
- **Car Selection**: Based on different criteria such as price range, brand, and car features, the program uses nested conditions to filter the best options for the customer.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: The system prompts the user for different choices and displays information dynamically, adjusting to the user's selections by evaluating conditions in layers using nested `if` statements.

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of nested `if` functions to handle complex decision trees and deliver a seamless, interactive experience in a car showroom context.
